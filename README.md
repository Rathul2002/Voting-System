# Online Voting System

## Description

The Online Voting System is a web-based application designed to facilitate secure and anonymous voting. The system verifies voters via their EPIC ID and Date of Birth (DOB), sends an OTP (One-Time Password) to their registered email, and ensures secure voting by verifying the OTP. The application maintains voter anonymity and ensures that each voter can only vote once.

## Features

- **Voter Verification**: Verifies voters using EPIC ID and DOB.
- **OTP Generation and Validation**: Sends an OTP to the voterâ€™s email and validates it.
- **Vote Submission**: Allows authenticated users to cast their votes for different political parties.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends OTPs via email and maintains their expiry.
- **Anonymous Voting**: Ensures voter anonymity by using OTPs and secure encoding methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the RESTful API.
- **Hibernate/JPA**: ORM for database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Database to store voter information and voting data.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend logic for interacting with the backend API.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling for the web interface.
- **Spring Mail**: For sending OTP emails.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: For managing OTP expiry and cleanup.
